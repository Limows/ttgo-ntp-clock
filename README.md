# ttgo-ntp-clock
Watch for ESP32 with OLED using NTP for time synchronization.
Forked from https://github.com/danielkucera/esp32-oled-clock and ported to TTGO T-Display.
Theoretically, they will work unchanged on any esp32 board with a st7789 display driver and a resolution of 135x240.
Also, you need TFT_eSPI and NTPClient libraries to build this sketch.
